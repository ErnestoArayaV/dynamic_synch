# dynamic_synch
Matlab files with proposed dynamic synchronization algorithms.

# Description: 
**main**:   -main_tests_so2.m (runs some tests with synthetic data for all algorithms below)<br><br>
**dynamic SO2 synchronization algorithms** (names are selfexplanatory): 
1. algo_spectral_so2.m 
2. algo_ppm_so2.m
3. algo_TRSglobal_so2.m
4. algo_TRSblock_so2.m
5. algo_denoiseNproject_so2.m<br>
                                  
**data generation**:
1. generate_ground_truth.m (sample random angles and impose smoothness by projection)
2. generate_AGN_signal.m (spike wigner model, add Gaussian noise to ground truth generated by generate_ground_truth.m)<br>
                   
**useful/auxiliary functions**:
1. complextoreal.m (real representation of complex vectors/matrices, doubles the dimension)
2. realtocomplex.m (do the inverse of complextoreal.m)
3. laplacian_path.m (create a laplacian mat. of a path graph of given size)
4. proj_1.m (project a complex vector such that every coordinate is on the complex circle)
5. proj_2.m (anchors a complex vector such that the first coordinate is one, done blockwise)
6. projmat_smalleigs_lap.m (define a low freq. projection matrix based on path laplacian)
7. TRSgep (trs solver, coded by Yuji Nakatsukasa).
