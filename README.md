# dynamic_synch
Matlab files with proposed dynamic synchronization algorithms.

# Description: 
main:   -main_tests_so2.m (runs some tests with synthetic data for all algorithms below)
dynamic SO2 synchronization algorithms (names are selfexplanatory): -algo_spectral_so2.m 
                                                                    -algo_ppm_so2.m
                                                                    -algo_TRSglobal_so2.m
                                                                    -algo_TRSblock_so2.m
                                                                    -algo_denoiseNproject_so2.m
data generation:   -generate_ground_truth.m (sample random angles and impose smoothness by projection)
                   -generate_AGN_signal.m (spike wigner model, add Gaussian noise to ground truth generated by generate_ground_truth.m)
useful/auxiliary functions: -complextoreal.m (real representation of complex vectors/matrices, doubles the dimension)
                  -realtocomplex.m (do the inverse of complextoreal.m)
                  -laplacian_path.m (create a laplacian mat. of a path graph of given size)
                  -proj_1.m (project a complex vector such that every coordinate is on the complex circle)
                  -proj_2.m (anchors a complex vector such that the first coordinate is one, done blockwise)
                  -projmat_smalleigs_lap.m (define a low freq. projection matrix based on path laplacian)
                  -TRSgep (trs solver, coded by Yuji Nakatsukasa).
