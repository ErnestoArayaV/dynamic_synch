1) For each algorithm, optimize the choice of the regularization parameter... over a grid in a dynamic 
env approach. 
Q: Within what boundary to discretize? Have this boundary automated.


2) Wrapper for loops around noise levels, for a fixed configuration (eg fix n, T), for each of the noise models.

3) Ranking application:
   (a) synthetic 
   (b) real data





Future work:
    - binary search
    - [0, M], binary [0, M/2, M], [0, M/4, M/2, 3/4M, M]; and so on... 10 steps?
